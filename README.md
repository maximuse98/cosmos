Hello Humans(I hope so)!

This project is just for studying, nothing interesting. It was made to learn Git, Hibernate, Java and maybe css (i still dont know,
maybe we havent enough time) I dont know why are you reading this. Maybe, you are my teammate. If yes, download it and add something 
good here and make this code better! Maybe, you are my lecturer. I think, she dont know english very well, but she can still use 
translator... 

Anyway, if you have questions like 'Why did they do this? It has not ane sense!' I have only one answer - its a business rule!
Our customer multiplies our salaries twice for each new stupid business rule. He paid for such famous systems like Jira or Gantter 
(bad example) or Kanban, until their trial period expired. You never guess our salary, if you count from one. So just imagine, what kind
of work are we doing and treat to us with understanding.

Thank you for your attention!
